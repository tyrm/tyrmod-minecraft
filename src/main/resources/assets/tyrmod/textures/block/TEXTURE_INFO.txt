SMOOTH STONE STAIRS TEXTURE SETUP
==================================

The smooth stone stairs block uses two textures:

1. VANILLA SMOOTH STONE (for bottom and all sides):
   - minecraft:block/smooth_stone
   - This is the vanilla smooth stone texture from Minecraft
   - Used for: bottom, sides, front, and back faces

2. CUSTOM TOP (texture needed):
   - File location: smooth_stone_stairs_top.png
   - This texture will be used for the top/tread surface of each stair step
   - Should be a 16x16 PNG file

To complete the texture setup:
1. Create one 16x16 PNG file with your custom top texture
2. Name it: smooth_stone_stairs_top.png
3. Place it in this directory (src/main/resources/assets/tyrmod/textures/block/)

All other faces will use the vanilla smooth stone texture.
